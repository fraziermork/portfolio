AS A DEVELOPER
--I want the code to be clean and easy to debug (or as easy as that can be)
--I want the code to be written with the principles of functional programming in mind
--I want to user a mobile-first approach and have a responsive design.
--I want to be careful about my user interaction so that I am sensitive to the differences in events from mobile touch screens to desktops
--I want to carefully think about separation-of-concerns so that no individual feature is hidden within a bajillion lines of code (or more!)
--I want to use SMACSS so that it is easy for me to find CSS relevant to any particular item
--I want to throw out old/dead code so that my project isn't a bloated corpse
--I want to use templates to DRY out my code and make it easier for me to pop content in/out of places.
--I want to wrap my stuff in an IFFE and export it to the window so that I don't pollute the global namespace
--I want to demonstrate a proficiency with multiple different concepts, like AJAX, local storage, functional programming, APIs, SQL if possible, git (if that makes sense),
--I want to have a portfolio with the ability to grow so that I am not limited in the amount of projects I can include
--I want adding projects and features to be as painless as possible and not have to re-work the whole site
--I want to add a way for users to filter the content that they see based on criteria, like publication date, category,
--I want the code to be commented in a way that enhances readability, but also to ensure that my code is readable on its own
--I want to implement a way to contact me via email, but hopefully have to reinvent email--look into email APIs
--If a user starts to write an email and then closes their page accidentally or presses back or goes to look at another section, I want the contents of their email to persist (probably in LS), then eliminate them from LS once the email has been sent
--If there are multiple images being displayed in a large container, I want to use some sort of image slider.
--I want to attach event listeners in a sensible way so that events are delegated if possible, but not so that delegation of events starts to infringe on readability, functionality, etc.
--I don't want any code leftover from previous implementations--Ex: if I had something with a display flex from before, I want to remove it if it is no longer necessary so that I don't get weird issues appearing from remnants of failed solutions to previous bugs


AS SOMEONE TRYING TO GET HIRED
--I want to be able to show the page to everyone--potential employers, people I'm trying to network with, friends and potentially technologically-impaired relatives
--I want to create a memorable portfolio so that potential employers will remember me
--I want to include unique features that will encourage users/employers to spend some time playing with my website in addition to looking at my projects
--I want users to have fun and laugh if possible, but not in a way that compromises my professionalism
--I want to ensure that any unique designs do not interfere with usability
--I want to explain the design of the page in a way that makes it seem cool and makes me not seem crazy/have a weird obsession
--I want to showcase my best projects in a way that allows the user to interact with them if possible
--I want my portfolio to demonstrate some proficiency with design as well as with programming
--I want my portfolio to demonstrate some proficiency with user experience as well as with programming
--Before deploying I want to remove all console.log messages, except maybe one to visitors
--I want potential employers/users to get a feel for my personality so that they like me on a personal level as well--develop a voice with my writing and page content
--I want to demonstrate an understanding of the software development process/lifecycle with user stories, gitflow, sprints,
--I want all text to be clear and concise
--I want potential employers to know that I am in the Seattle area
--I want users to be able to easily contact me, preferably via email
--If I include a demo module I want it to work correctly--the clock needs to run on time, the calculator needs to be able to calculate, etc.
--I want demos to have a scalable size so that they are responsive in the same way that the rest of the page is.
--Not all my demos are square--I want them to fit in a square when viewed on the big spiral, but like in the case of the calculator, to be sensitive to their height on the mobile view so that they aren't cramped weirdly.



AS A USER
--I want the page to work regardless of what platform I am viewing it on
--I want the page to be intuitive to use--I can easily navigate it even if I have never been there before, if I revisit the page I can remember where things are, if I encounter a subfeature like a demo module I know how to use it without thinking, there are no frustrating moments when navigating the page
--I want the page to make it clear when I am interacting with something
--I want the page to load quickly and respond quickly to my actions
--I want the page to look aesthetically pleasing in terms of color, design, font,
--I want the text to be easily readable
--I want to be able to contact the site's owner easily and know how to do that without having to search
--I want to see cool projects inside that impress me even if they are simple
--I want to be able to play with things on the site, not just look at static images
--I want the page to include some humor--I want to laugh and enjoy myself
--I want to want to show/share the page with other people



AS A POTENTIAL EMPLOYER
--I want the portfolio page to be professional in appearance, content, and language
--I want the page to be coded in a way that demonstrates a proficiency with coding--i.e. functionally, conforms to convention, etc.
--I want easy access to your github, linkedIn, and contact information so that I can further evaluate you as a candidate
--I want the projects inside to be coded professionally, be interesting, and be non-trivial
--I want to hire a candidate who is smart, so I want your page to show that you are smart, eager to learn, able to solve problems, etc.
--I want to be able to tell from your page that your personality wouldn't clash with current employees--that we could hire you and on a personal level you wouldn't be a problem
--I want to see which languages each of your portfolio projects was written in so that I can tell which languages you know, whether you know several, etc.
